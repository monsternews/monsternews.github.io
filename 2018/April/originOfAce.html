	<h2>The Origin of the Ace</h2>
	<h3>Many people debate over whether the Ace in a deck if cards is stronger than a King or weaker than a Two, but few know the creator's intent</h3>

	<p>    Historians credit the addition of an Ace to a standard deck of cards to Sir Geoffrey James II, who had a lifetime obsession with cards. He added the card in 1794 because the favorite game of many at the time, Ruples, he felt needed a card that was between an Eight and a Seven. From this idea, he created the Ace. Where does the name come from? The beginning sound of each word. The "ei" in Eight is pronounced like a hard "a" as in Ace, and the "ce" in Ace is pronounced like the "se" in Seven. Although the spelling masks this beginning, still in some dialects this addition of sounds works well.</p>
    <p>    James II may now be forgotten by most, but his invention of the Ace lives on.</p>
